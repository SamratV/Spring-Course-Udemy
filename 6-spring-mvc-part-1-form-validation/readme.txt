NOTE:
	1) First add all the spring jars to "WEB-INF/lib" folder and also "javax.servlet.jsp.jstl-1.2.1.jar",
	"javax.servlet.jsp.jstl-api-1.2.1.jar" (last 2 jars where provided in the lecture number 99: Download
	Spring MVC Starter Files). Also copy the "web.xml" and "spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml" from the lecture
	number 99: Download Spring MVC Starter Files.
	
	2) Also add the hibernate jars highlighted in the image "jars.png", which is in the same directory.

	3) "src/resources/messages.properties" was added to define custom error messages.
	The "resources" folder should strictly be placed inside the "src" folder only. 
	"spring-mvc-demo-servlet.xml" was also edited. Look for "Step 6" in the XML file.
	Also have a look at the comments in the Customer class, "readme3.png", "readme4.png" and screenshots.
